## About CollectionBuilder CSV

This is my collectionbuilder page for Jesse's class. I'm watching a video about the Songbirds and Snakes movie while I write this and one of the characters is named Sejanus, who is also a major character in one of my favorite books, the King of Attolia. I can't believe that multiple characters from different books can be named the same thing. I don't think my vscode and Github account are connected properly.
